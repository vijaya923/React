Abstraction: Abstraction in Typescript, as in object-oriented programming generally, is the concept of hiding 
complex implementation details and exposing only the essential, relevant information to the user. It focuses on 
"what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.

1. Abstraction can be achieved using interfaces.

   Syntax:

     interface InterfaceName {
        property1: dataType;
        property2: dataType;

        method1(): returnType;
        method2(): returnType;
        method3(): returnType;

     }
      
      class ClassName implements InterfaceName {
         property1: dataType = value;

         method(): returnType {
            
         }


      }
